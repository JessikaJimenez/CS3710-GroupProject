# CS3710-GroupProject

----- CAPMAN -----  
A video game made from Verilog/Assembly/Python which plays similarly to Pac-Man but isn't Pac-Man.  
Can be played by taking all the files in this repository and loading them onto a De1-Soc FPGA board, that also has a NES controller or gyroscope hat controller connected to it.  
Please refer to the "Documentation for Final Project Submission" and "Final Project Report" for more details on the project.
