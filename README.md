# CS3710-GroupProject

----- CAPMAN -----  
A video game made from Verilog/Assembly/Python which plays similarly to Pac-Man but isn't Pac-Man.  
Can be played by taking all the files in this repository and loading them onto a De1-Soc FPGA board.  
Additionally, a NES controller or a gyroscope hat controller, and a VGA-compatible monitor also need to be conencted to the FPGA board.   
Please refer to the "Documentation for Final Project Submission" and "Final Project Report" for more details on the project.
