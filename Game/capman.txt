# Potential setup code

# Start of program, sets up Capman game then proceeds with infinite loop
#
# %r1 - Capman State (1 is Capman is alive, 0 if Capman is dead)
# %r2 - Capman X Position (Cannot exceed 640)
# %r3 - Capman Y Position (Cannot exceed 480)
# %r4 - Capman Direction (00 = Down, 01 = Right, 10 = Left, 11 = Up)
# %r5 - Capman Position Jump (Determines speed, hardcoded to ?)
#
.START # START OF GAME
MOVI %r1 $1 # r1 = 1
